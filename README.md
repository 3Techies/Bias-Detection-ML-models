# Bias-Detection-ML-models
This is a group project from 3 sophomore year undergrads at IIT Patna. --sanjay's version
<hr>
The project aims to Find, Analyse and Mitigate Biases in  ML models.
<br>
DAKSH IS A DONKEY!!!

Perfect. Here’s a **clear, realistic 12-week workflow** for the **Bias Detection in AI Models** project, designed for **3 CS sophomores**, with **no panic weeks** and a strong finish.

I’ll show:
- What happens **each week**
- **Who does what**
- What the **output** of each week should be  

Think of this as a **project GPS**.

# 🗓️ 12-Week Workflow — Bias Detection in AI Models

---

## 🟢 WEEKS 1–2: Foundation & Direction
**Goal:** Everyone understands the problem and setup works.

---

### ✅ Week 1 — Problem Understanding + Dataset
**All 3 together**
- Understand what “bias in ML” means (at a high level)
- Decide the **problem domain** (loan, hiring, student performance)
- Choose **1 dataset**
- Identify **sensitive attribute(s)**

**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Think about what models can be used
- **P2:** Inspect dataset columns, group distributions
- **P3:** Set up GitHub repo + basic structure

**Deliverable**
✔ Dataset finalized  
✔ Repo created  
✔ Problem statement written (1 paragraph)

---

### ✅ Week 2 — Environment & Baseline Setup
**Goal:** Everything runs end-to-end.

**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Train first simple model (logistic regression)
- **P2:** Clean data, handle missing values
- **P3:** Set up Streamlit skeleton (empty UI)

**Deliverable**
✔ First model trains successfully  
✔ Data preprocessing pipeline  
✔ App skeleton runs

---

## 🟡 WEEKS 3–4: Baseline Models & Normal Metrics
**Goal:** A working ML system (no bias yet).

---

### ✅ Week 3 — Multiple Models
**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Train 2–3 models (LR, RF, GB)
- **P2:** Feature scaling & encoding
- **P3:** Add model selection option in UI

**Deliverable**
✔ Multiple trained models  
✔ Accuracy / precision / recall computed  

---

### ✅ Week 4 — Standard Evaluation
**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Compare models on normal metrics
- **P2:** Plot feature distributions
- **P3:** Display metrics in dashboard

**Deliverable**
✔ “Best” model by accuracy identified  
✔ Baseline performance report  

📌 *At this point, your model looks “good”… but bias is still hidden.*

---

## 🔵 WEEKS 5–6: Bias Detection (Core of Project)
**Goal:** Actually detect unfairness.

---

### ✅ Week 5 — Group-wise Evaluation
**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Compute metrics per group
- **P2:** Compare outcome rates per group
- **P3:** Visualize group comparisons

**Deliverable**
✔ Approval/rejection rates by group  
✔ First visible bias evidence  

---

### ✅ Week 6 — Fairness Metrics
**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Implement fairness metrics
- **P2:** Validate results statistically
- **P3:** Show fairness numbers in UI

**Deliverable**
✔ Quantified bias metrics  
✔ Clear fairness violations shown  

📌 *This is where your project becomes “non-generic”.*

---

## 🟠 WEEKS 7–8: Why Bias Happens
**Goal:** Explain the bias, not just show it.

---

### ✅ Week 7 — Dataset & Feature Bias
**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Identify model behavior differences
- **P2:** Correlation & imbalance analysis
- **P3:** Add feature plots to dashboard

**Deliverable**
✔ Proxy features identified  
✔ Data imbalance explained  

---

### ✅ Week 8 — Bias Attribution
**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Model-specific feature importance
- **P2:** SHAP analysis (lightweight)
- **P3:** Visual explanation section

**Deliverable**
✔ Clear explanation of bias sources  
✔ Feature-level reasoning  

---

## 🔴 WEEKS 9–10: Bias Mitigation & Trade-offs
**Goal:** Fix bias and show consequences.

---

### ✅ Week 9 — Bias Mitigation
**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Apply mitigation methods
- **P2:** Check group improvements
- **P3:** Add before/after toggle

**Deliverable**
✔ Reduced bias observed  
✔ Updated model versions  

---

### ✅ Week 10 — Trade-off Analysis
**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Measure accuracy vs fairness
- **P2:** Compare across models
- **P3:** Visualize trade-offs

**Deliverable**
✔ Accuracy–fairness plots  
✔ Honest trade-off discussion  

📌 *This is the most interview-important part.*

---

## 🟣 WEEKS 11–12: Polish & Presentation
**Goal:** Make it resume-ready.

---

### ✅ Week 11 — Dashboard & UX Polish
**Person-wise**
- **P1:** Final model selection
- **P2:** Final analysis write-up
- **P3:** Clean UI, add explanations

**Deliverable**
✔ Clean, understandable dashboard  
✔ Final results locked  

---

### ✅ Week 12 — Documentation & Demo
**All 3 together**
- Write README
- Record demo video (optional)
- Practice explanation
- Prepare resume bullets

**Deliverable**
✔ Professional GitHub repo  
✔ Interview-ready explanation  

---

## 📦 Final Outputs (What You’ll Have)

- ✔ Bias detection system
- ✔ Interactive dashboard
- ✔ Clear fairness metrics
- ✔ Bias mitigation results
- ✔ Trade-off analysis
- ✔ Strong resume bullets

---

## 🧠 Time Reality Check
- ~5–7 hrs/person/week is enough
- No week is overloaded
- Parallel work is maximized

---

## 🏁 One-Line Project Timeline Summary
> Weeks 1–4 build the model,  
> Weeks 5–8 expose the bias,  
> Weeks 9–10 reduce the bias,  
> Weeks 11–12 package it professionally.
